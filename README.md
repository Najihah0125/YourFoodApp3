# YourFood App - A Xamarin Forms Application for Mobile Application Development Subject Final Project
Anemic individuals have low hemoglobin which causes them always to feel tired and weak. This is because of the lack of red blood cells to carry oxygen to their whole body. Anemic individuals must follow strict diets to increase back their hemoglobin levels. Therefore, Your Food is a mobile application created to suggest food recipes for anemic individuals. This app helps individualsto meet their nutritional needs by providing helpful cooking ways for anemic-friendly meals. It also encourages anemic individuals to cook for themselves by allowing them to save their favourite recipes to cook daily and add their own recipes.



List of application features with its description:
1. Recipes:
   The system will display a list of food recipes suitable for anemic individuals. Each recipe contains the recipe name, description, image, list of ingredients, steps to cook and cooking time.
